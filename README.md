Dear researchers, 

Due to copyright issues, we can only provide part of the speech data in CNSCED on this website.

If you want to obtain the complete data, please contact wuxl@stu.xju.edu.cn.

The file name includes speaker gender, speaker number, voice number, emotion category and intensity.

Emotion category: A: Angry, S: Sad, W: Aroused, H: Happy, F: Fear, B Surprised, 0: Neutral.

Emotion intensity: 1: Weak Intensity, 2: Medium Intensity, 3: Strong Intensity

Take the sample F0001-0008-A2_S1_W2.wav, where F means female, 0001 means speaker with sequence number 1, and 0008 means the 8-th sentence said by this speaker. The following content indicates that medium-intensity angry and aroused coexist with weak-intensity sadness.
